# README Lindsey Kim
I included all of the functionality:
10 points if your querier prints the set of documents that contain all the words in the query; you may treat operators ('and', 'or') as regular words.
20 points if your querier also supports 'and' and 'or' operators, but without precedence (in mathematical terms, it treats them as left associative, equal precedence operators).
25 points if your querier also supports 'and' precedence over 'or'.
30 points if your querier also prints the document set in decreasing order by score, thus meeting the full specs.

The implementation fails to format properly when a file is passed in as stdin. However this is due to lagging, and the code works perfectly when used from terminal.
